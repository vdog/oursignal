  ## TODO

  * Hover mini-meta for PC users.
  * Front end Javascript and routing could be bettr. Backbone or Ember it.
  * Make deep linking to link meta data possible (free with Backbone or Ember).
  * Flashes of unstyled content in a few places.
  * JSONP.
  * More meta data.
  * Timeline UI.

  ## Changelog

  ### 10/11/2013
  * Killed open metadata fault.  You can still turn it on if you wish to view the scores.
  * Migrated from unicorn to puma.
  * So the free tier wasn't so free the first month.  EBS gives 2 million iop's for free.  Oursignal2 used 200 million.  I did no analysis, but I suspected dynamically generating /timestep.json was the cause since it required postgress queries to get the links.  Here are some steps to combat:
        * Moved dynamic URL /timestep.json to static URL /js/timestep.json.  Created a cron job to update timestep.json every 5 minutes after bucket and score updates.
        * Most static files are served up directly by nginx instead of the application server. (Yay Chef for making that easy).
  
  ### 08/28/2013
  * Moved to free tier on aws.  New management by Vince at http://www.locavore-roar.com

  ### 03/07/2012

  * Source URLs go to the correct place now.

  ### 26/06/2012

  * Middle click treemap links now fall back to browser default action.
  * Added correct E-Tags and Last-Modified.

  ### 25/06/2012

  #### Removed features:

    * Delicious is dead and has been removed.
    * Custom feeds will be gone for now. If I can afford the server costs to bring them back via donations or another revenue model then I will.
    * Themes are gone, the one and only theme is a return towards the simpler original OurSignal UI for those that remember it. Instead the [JSON API](/api) will give you access to more meta data for each link. As long as you don't DOS the website I will never restrict access for competing visualizations so you can easily build and host your own visualizations.

  #### Additional features:

    * Twitter RT count, Google +1's and Facebook likes are now used in score calculation.
    * History in 10 minute intervals exists via the API. The UI is a work in progress still.
    * Access meta data without mouseover. Swipe up on tablets to close meta window.
